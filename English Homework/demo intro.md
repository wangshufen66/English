hi,everyone:

Today, my demo presentation may be a little difficult for you to understand, because I'm a project team that joined this week. I'm still in the stage of understanding the project and MAC environment configuration, and the overall project hasn't run successfully My current project is app project. Due to the particularity of the project, I can't use the simulator on the computer to run, but can only use the real machine to run. This is also unfriendly to this demo demonstration.

My task this week is to do some development tasks with changing requirements in the app after successfully running the project According to my current understanding of this Olay app, this app is a convenient management system for each store in each region. You can check the monthly sales volume of a store, transaction details, completion progress, new customers, inventory of each store and some other things.



今天我的demo演示对你们来说可能有点难以理解,因为我是这周一才进的项目组,目前还在了解项目和Mac电脑环境配置阶段,整体的项目还没运行成功.我现在做的项目是APP项目,由于项目的特殊性,不能用电脑上的模拟器运行,只能用真机调试,这点也是对这个demo演示不友好的地方.

本周我的任务是在成功运行项目之后做一些app中需求变化的开发任务.以我目前对这个OLAY  APP理解,这个APP是一个方便对每个地区每个店面的管理系统.你可以查看某个店面每个月销量,交易明细,完成的的进度,新增的客户,和每个店面的库存和一些其他的东西.
