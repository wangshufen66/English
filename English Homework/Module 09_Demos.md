**Module 09_Demos**





- Today I want to show you how    / so let’s see how 
- We will demonstrate how to do that by
-  All that the user has to do is
- Here, if we go back to… and have a look at... we will see...
-  That’s basically because...  (=to sum up the reasons)
-  do that by creating
-  what you need to do is
- *So what you can see here is a big red button.*

- All that the user needs to do is click that button.
- Here we go.   我们开始了
- So now what I’ll do is I’ll close that window.
- And so what I’m gonna be doing is I’m just gonna be running the test.
-  When I run it, it should  bring up  a sign-in dialogue.
- Let me give you more of the detailed deep-dive on the application.
- Now let's go to the main menu.
- As you can see here
- If you have any questions,feel free to interrupt me or ask them at the end.
- Similarly, we can also create ... [= in the same way]
- Now let's take you through how we implemented it.
- And what's going to happen is a new file just popped into my folder.
- So, this is all I wanted to show you today, thank you for your time.
- Now, what you can see is that I'm caching the refresh token.
- Right, let's look at how we've implemented user story 2 ...

- So **now what** I'll do is I'll come here and I'll hit Publish Quiz.
- Now let's **go back** to the Chrome window.
- **I’m going to show you** how the new features work. **First, we’ll look at how we implemented feature X. **Then, I’ll **go through** what we did to implement feature Z. **If you have any questions, feel free to interrupt me or ask them at the end.**
- So what you **can** see is that I’m caching the refresh token, and I’m using this refresh token to regenerate an access token.
- So when I run it, it **should bring up** the Google sign in dialogue as set up through, **here we go**, right in the middle, Windows 8.
- **Just a minute, let me quickly** unzip this archive **so that I can show** **you** what files were created.
- Here I’d like to **mention** that when we tried to put that data on a network all at once, **we discovered that** we would basically crush the network.
- We will **demonstrate how to do that by implementing** a web-based text editor.
