#### Module 04_Softening



| 1.   Wouldn’t this  be a bit [too] difficult with the limited  time? |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2.   I’m afraid it  seems we might miss the deadline.        |
| 3.   Your code seems to contain a few mistakes.              |
| 4.   Wouldn’t this  cost a  bit  too much?                   |
| 5.   I’m not quite  sure it’s the best idea.                 |
| 6.   There seems to be a  problem with the report you sent me. |
| 7.   It might be slightly difficult for the user to get used  to this interface. |
| 8.   Don’t you think  this might be a bit confusing?         |
| 9.   Setting up a  one-page site doesn’t seem a very good idea. |



1) **Wouldn’t** this be **a bit** confusing for the users? / **Wouldn’t** the users find it **a bit** confusing?

2) **I think** it **might** be **better** to wait until next year.

3) It **might** be **a bit** difficult for people to get used to this new look.

4) I’m **afraid** it’s not the **best** idea to change the design at this point. This **would** cost a lot.

5) The figures in the report that you sent **don’t seem to be right** / It **seems** that the figures in the report that you sent **aren’t [quite] right**.

6) **Don’t** you think this will be **a bit too** expensive? / **Wouldn’t** this cost **a bit too much**?



So there's one final spot where it actually sometimes makes sense to cache stuff, and this might be a bit sort of unintuitive. You can actually use the data store as a cache.

**Task 1**. 

- **Wouldn’t** it be **better** to wait until next year? / *Wouldn’t it be a better choice that we wait until next year*

- Your patch **doesn’t seem** **to work**

- So **I’m afraid** it seems like **we might miss** the deadline.

- Mm, **wouldn’t** this be **a bit** too difficult with the limited time?

- I’m afraid it **doesn’t seem** to offer a real solution to the problem.

- Don’t you think it **would** be better not to make any changes?

- **Wouldn’t** it be **better** not to make any changes?

- The interface **seems (a bit / quite) difficult to use.** /It **seems that the interface is (a bit /quite) difficult to use)**

- It **might / would** be **better to use another approach / a more effective approach**

- I’m afraid I don't quite agree. 

- Wouldn’t it be a bit difficult? 

- I'm afraid this would mean higher costs. 

  



**Task 2.**(review)

(a) Could you speak up a bit, please?

(b) Can I get this clear? You’re saying that it won’t be finished by next week?

(c ) Hang on… I’m trying to sort the problem out.

(d) So if I understand you correctly, the deadline will be extended? 

(e) What’s the weather like in San Francisco? 

(f) How’s it going, Mike? What’s new? 

(g) I’m afraid I didn’t catch it. You’re breaking up a little bit.

(h) How’s your day been so far, Jake?

(i) Sorry about that. Please bear with me - we’re trying to fix the problems with the sound.

(j) Sorry, guys, I was/got cut off.
